My name is **Richard Orfao**, I am currently an international student at **Florida International University** Modesto A. Maidique Campus.
I am an international student from Venezuela. I arrived 2 years and a half ago and started studying English at FIU at the English language Institute. Then I transferred to Miami Dade College after 2 semesters to complete my Associate in Arts. Now that I have my A.A. and I am studying at FIU pursuing a bachelors in IT. I am looking for a job since I want to get experience in my field and I will be extremely helpful for me in the future.
